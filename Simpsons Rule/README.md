# Simpsons 1/3 Algorithm 

This Algorithm takes in data in this case a lower and upper bound as well as the function or data set that is going to be evaluated.
then is put through the simpsons 1/3 process, in short three values are are plugged into the Simpsons 1/3 formula and a value is outputed. 
This is done for however many subintervals are avaliable, in this exact sode if the subintervals aren't in a factor of three than the trapezoidal integration is preformed for that remaining interval. 
The outputs of this evaluation can be summed up as that area under the curve or the integrated value of the given data.
