# False Position Root Finding 
This algorthm is a root finding method which is similar to bisection but instead retains estimates for the function 
value that has and opposite sign from the function is the best current estimate. 
Initially there are two points choosen an upper and a lower bound, then is goes into the loop where it makes calculations 
and compares it to the previous values if the sign changes then the other bound is replaced. 
This algorithm is error based.
